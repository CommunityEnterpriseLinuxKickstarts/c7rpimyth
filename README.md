centos 7 on the raspberrypi with *mythtv

    *Currently, I use an older mythtv version 28.2 in my projects. Usage of older software may NOT make you many friends , if you tell anyone close to upstream. Note: This is not the kernel/OS we are talking about here, just the mythtv application.
    I'll update it when i can,  I  personally have a lot of projects I have to  bring into sync when I do, feel free to rebuild your own in the meanwhile. Pretty sure I and others give enough information for one to do that.

2 images Built and available now on SF. Version r01 is xfce4 based and r02 is lxqt based.

c7 armhfp on the rpi came from the community and people at centos, I took a few sources and 
with livemedia-creator I reworked it a bit and respun it with mythtv and openmax support.

This project will take over where I left off with the raspbian mythtv projects and now those projects will be converted over to  centos 7 armhfp based.  Now that I have seen and worked with the stable centos 7 armhfp build system thats now available, its the best for me.
Is it fast as raspbian, no, it takes overclocking it to compare in my brief review, but I still like it since my background has been more rpm based than deb based. I like to build rpms, I dont enjoy building debs.

*LMC sure makes building images easier than the old manual methods either will installroot or livecd-creator.
