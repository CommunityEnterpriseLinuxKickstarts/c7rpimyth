centos 7 on the raspberrypi with *mythtv

    *I use a old mythtv version 28 which will not make you many friends I'm sure, if you tell anyone close to upstream.
    I'll update it when i can I have a lot o projects I have to  bring into sync when I do, feel free to rebuild your own in the meanwhile. Pretty sure I and others give enough information for one to do that.

Built and available soon. Two versions r01 is xfce4 based  and r02 is lxqt based.

c7 armhfp on the rpi came from the community and people at centos, I took a few sources and 
with livemedia-creator I reworked it a bit and respun it with mythtv and openmax support.

This project will take over where I left off with the raspbian mythtv  projects and now those projects will be converted over to  centos 7 armhfp based.  Now that I have seen and worked with the stable centos 7 armhfp build system thats now available, its the best for me.
Is it fast as raspbian, no, it takes overclocking it to compare in my brief review, but I still like it since my background has been more rpm based than deb based. I like to build rpms, I dont enjoy building debs.


When it stabilizes I will put the sources all here, build scripts and all for now you can get the kickstarts and images on sf.

*LMC sure makes building images easier than the old manual methods either will installroot or livecd-creator.
