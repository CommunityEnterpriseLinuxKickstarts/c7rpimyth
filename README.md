centos 7 on the raspberrypi with mythtv

Built! Fine Tuning now IN PROGRESS. Release soon. 

c7 armhfp on the rpi came from the community and people at centos, I took a few sources and 
with livemedia-creator I reworked it a bit and respun it with mythtv and openmax support.

This project will take over where I left off with the raspbian mythtv  projects and now those projects will be converted over to  centos 7 armhfp based.  Now that I have seen and worked with the stable centos 7 armhfp build system thats now available, its the best for me.

BL. I just want to say. livemedia-creator is a picky picky picky itchy picky,where am i going with this...
uhm great program! :) I admit lmc is difficult but still yet easier than working with ole livecd-creator on install images.
